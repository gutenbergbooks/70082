DISSERTATION concluded.


The limits of this extensive family may be considered, with some degree
of accuracy, to be bounded by about three hundred (species and distinct
varieties): consequently, in the termination of this Volume, the Genus
may be regarded as half delineated. The Cape of Good Hope has been, and
still continues to be, the emporium for this unrivalled tribe of plants;
and unless some new source should be found to extend this already
numerous Genus, by the discovery of some unexpected mine of novelty; we
otherwise have little doubt but the termination of the Sixth Volume will
be found to contain all the species and distinct varieties. The
difficulty of preserving many of this fine tribe is still a subject of
general complaint, and by no means easy to be remedied where the
situation is low, as the great enemies of the Ericas are the fogs, which
invariably gravitate towards the marshes and low grounds; but where
the situation is elevated and open, the preservation of the major part
of them is by no means so difficult. Greater care is requisite in the
watering of them than is generally imagined, as too much renders them
weak, and subjects them to damp off; whilst, on the contrary, too little
is frequently fatal; for, if they once droop their heads for want of
water, they very rarely survive the neglect.
